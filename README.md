# NextJs Blog Application

A simple blog application built with NextJs.

## Getting Started

1. I have used a custom port, so run with `npm run dev -- -p 3100`.
   You can change to a port number of your choice by changing `"dev:" npm run dev [your_port_number]` the in the `package.json` file.

2. Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) with your browser to see the result.

3. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3100/api/hello](http://localhost:3100/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
